- Knuth Notes:
    - Appendix A (answers starts at pg. 304)
    - Conditionals: Knuth pg. 209
    - Expansion: Knuth pg. 212
        - when TEX is taking care of a \def, the <control sequence>,
          the <parameter text>, and the <replacement text> of that
          \def are not subject to expansion. Similarly, the two tokens
          after \ifx are never expanded
    - assignments: Knuth pg. 206
        - \chardef\cs=<number> makes \cs a character code;
        - \countdef\cs=<number> makes \cs a \count register;
        - \def\cs...{...} makes \cs a macro.
        - \edef\a{\double{xy}}: expanded macro definition
        - \let\cs=<token> gives \cs the token’s current meaning

    - \string: list of characters for that control sequence's name.
    - \csname<tokens>\endcsname: convert characters to control sequence
    - \csname\string\TeX\endcsname: produce unusual control sequence "\\TeX"
    - When \csname is used to define a control sequence for the first
      time, that control sequence is made equivalent to \relax until
      it is redefined.
    - if register \count5 holds the value 316, then ‘\number\count5’ produces "316"
    - \char<number>: where <number> is ASCII number from 0 to 255
    - `b: ASCII code for "b"
    - ^^@: ASCII 0, ^^A: ASCII 1, ^^_: ASCII 31
    - ^^00 to ^^ff: all ASCII characters
    - Knuth 46-48: reading/parsing (mouth) rules
    - Knuth Ch20: Macros
    - \tracingmacros=1: write something in log file whenever it
    - \tracingcommands=2: TEX will show all conditional commands and
      their outcome expands a macro, and whenever it has read a macro
      argument
    - \newcount: create allocate new 
    - \newtoks: allocate new token list parameter
        - assignment:
            - <token variable>={<replacement text>}
            - <token variable>=<token variable>
    - Expanded definitions that are made with \edef or \xdef continue
      to expand tokens until only unexpandable tokens remain, except
      that token lists produced by ‘\the’ are not expanded further.
      Furthermore a token following ‘\noexpand’ will not be expanded,
      since its ability to expand has been nullified. These two
      operations can be used to control what gets expanded and what
      doesn’t

- Quotes:
    Knuth: "...they have come to be known as macros because they are
    so powerful; one little macro can represent an enormous amount of
    material, so it has a sort of macroscopic effect."
